# 🚀 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge! This journey is all about improving my coding skills, exploring new languages, and having a lot of fun along the way. Here's the plan:

## Challenge Breakdown
- **Days 1-20:** C++ 🌟
- **Days 21-60:** Java ☕
- **Days 61-100:** Python 🐍

## Daily Log
I will be documenting my progress here daily. Follow along to see what I'm working on, what I've learned, and how I'm debugging both love and logic! 💖😄

| Day | Language | Topic/Project | Link to Code |
|-----|----------|---------------|--------------|
| 1   | C++      |               |              |
| 2   | C++      |               |              |
| ... | ...      |               |              |
| 100 | Python   |               |              |

## Goals
- **C++:** Strengthen my understanding of core concepts and solve complex problems.
- **Java:** Dive deep into object-oriented programming and develop some cool projects.
- **Python:** Explore data structures, algorithms, and dive into some machine learning basics.
