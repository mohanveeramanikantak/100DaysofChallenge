# üöÄ 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge! This journey is all about improving my coding skills, exploring new languages, and having a lot of fun along the way. Here's the plan:

## Challenge Breakdown
- **Days 1-20:** C++ üåü
- **Days 21-60:** Java ‚òï
- **Days 61-100:** Python üêç

## Daily Log
I will be documenting my progress here daily. Follow along to see what I'm working on, what I've learned, and how I'm debugging both love and logic! üíñüòÑ
